# CSS nth-child Pseudo-Class Demonstration

This project demonstrates the use of the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class in CSS, allowing developers to select elements based on their position inside a parent element.

## 📌 What is `nth-child`?
The `:nth-child(n)` selector matches elements based on their position among their siblings. It can be used with numeric values, formulas, or keywords like `odd` and `even`.

## 🎯 Features
- Selects specific child elements using `nth-child(n)`.
- Differentiates between `nth-child()` and `nth-of-type()`.
- Demonstrates first, last, even, and odd child selection.
- Provides interactive examples with highlighted selected elements.
- Includes **code snippets** for better understanding.

## 🖥️ Live Preview
Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the nth-child pseudo-classes in action.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Read through the examples and code snippets to understand `nth-child()` usage.

## 📌 Examples

### 1️⃣ Selecting the **Third** Child
```css
li:nth-child(3) {
    background-color: red;
    color: white;
}
```
👉 This selects the third `<li>` element inside a `<ul>`.

---

### 2️⃣ Selecting **Even & Odd** Children
```css
li:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color: lightgreen;
}

li:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
```
👉 This applies different styles to even and odd elements.

---

### 3️⃣ Selecting Every **3rd Child**
```css
li:nth-child(3n) {
    background-color: orange;
}
```
👉 This highlights every third child element.

---

### 4️⃣ Selecting the **First & Last** Child
```css
li:first-child {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}

li:last-child {
    background-color: purple;
    color: white;
}
```
👉 This applies styles to the **first** and **last** elements.

---

### 5️⃣ Difference Between `nth-child` and `nth-of-type`
```css
p:nth-child(2) {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
}

p:nth-of-type(2) {
    color: green;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```
👉 `nth-child` selects any element type at a given position, while `nth-of-type` selects elements of a specific type.
